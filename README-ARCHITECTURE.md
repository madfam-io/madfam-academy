# Educational Marketplace Platform - Architecture Overview

## 🏗️ System Design Summary

This repository contains the complete architecture design for a **multi-tenant educational marketplace platform** that enables instructors to create and sell courses while providing learners with a comprehensive catalog of educational content.

### Key Features
- 🏢 **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Complete tenant isolation with flexible deployment options
- 👥 **Persona-based System**: Role-specific experiences for learners, instructors, and admins
- 📚 **Advanced Catalog**: Full-text search, categories, recommendations
- 💳 **Integrated Commerce**: Stripe payments, subscriptions, revenue sharing
- 📊 **Analytics & Insights**: Real-time metrics for all user personas
- 🔐 **Enterprise Security**: JWT auth, OAuth2/SSO, row-level security

## 📁 Architecture Documentation

### Core Design Documents
- [`/architecture/educational-marketplace-design.md`](./architecture/educational-marketplace-design.md) - Comprehensive system design with:
  - Domain model and bounded contexts
  - Multi-tenant isolation strategies
  - Catalog system architecture
  - Persona-based permissions
  - Database schemas
  - Security considerations

### API Specification
- [`/api/openapi-spec.yaml`](./api/openapi-spec.yaml) - Complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification
  - RESTful endpoints for all resources
  - Authentication flows
  - Request/response schemas
  - Error handling

### Implementation Examples
- [`/src/domain/course/course.entity.ts`](./src/domain/course/course.entity.ts) - Domain-driven design implementation
- [`/src/infrastructure/multi-tenant/tenant.middleware.ts`](./src/infrastructure/multi-tenant/tenant.middleware.ts) - Multi-tenant middleware
- [`/src/infrastructure/auth/persona-permissions.ts`](./src/infrastructure/auth/persona-permissions.ts) - Permission system

### Architecture Diagrams

- [`/architecture/enrollment-flow.mmd`](./architecture/enrollment-flow.mmd) - Course enrollment sequence

## 🏛️ Architecture Highlights

### Domain-Driven Design
The system is organized into bounded contexts:
- **Identity & Access**: Authentication, authorization, multi-tenancy
- **Course Catalog**: Course management, discovery, categorization  
- **Learning Management**: Progress tracking, assessments, certificates
- **Commerce**: Payments, subscriptions, revenue sharing
- **Content Delivery**: Media streaming, CDN integration

### Multi-Tenant Strategy
- **Hybrid Approach**: Shared database with separate schemas + row-level security
- **Tenant Identification**: Subdomain, headers, or JWT claims
- **Complete Isolation**: Data, features, and billing per tenant

### Persona Architecture
Three primary personas with tailored experiences:
1. **Learners**: Browse, enroll, learn, earn certificates
2. **Instructors**: Create courses, manage content, view analytics
3. **Admins**: Manage platform, moderate content, configure settings

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js/TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js, React Native
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, AWS (RDS, S3, CloudFront)
- **Integrations**: Stripe, Elasticsearch, Redis
